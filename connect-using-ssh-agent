# ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519).
  

######
# verify that the ssh-agent is running

(base) quantum:~ mthomas$ ssh-add -l
The agent has no identities.

# cd into your .ssh directory:
(base) quantum:~ mthomas$ cd ~/.ssh

# generate a new key:
(base) quantum:~ mthomas$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f sdsc_id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

Your identification has been saved in sdsc_id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in sdsc_id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
